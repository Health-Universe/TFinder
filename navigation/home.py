It allows extracting directly the promoter or terminal regions of a gene via the NCBI API for 5 different species, with no limit on the number of genes. The reference pattern (ex: a TFBS) accepts both IUPAC codes and JASPAR entries. It is also possible to generate and to use a Position Weight Matrix (PWM). Finally, the data are presented in tabular form, along with a graph showing the relevance of the TFBSs found as a function of their relative position on the sequence.')
