        r"""Insert containers separated into tabs.

                Inserts a number of multi-element containers as tabs.
                Tabs are a navigational element that allows users to easily
                move between groups of related content.

                To add elements to the returned containers, you can use "with" notation
                (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See
                examples below.

                .. warning::
                    All the content of every tab is always sent to and rendered on the frontend.
                    Conditional rendering is currently not supported.

                Parameters
                ----------
                tabs : list of strings
                    Creates a tab for each string in the list. The first tab is selected by default.
                    The string is used as the name of the tab and can optionally contain Markdown,
                    supporting the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code,
                    Emojis, and Links.

                    This also supports:

                    * Emoji shortcodes, such as ``:+1:``  and ``:sunglasses:``.
                      For a list of all supported codes,
                      see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.

                    * LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$"
                      must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed
                      at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.

                    * Colored text, using the syntax ``:color[text to be colored]``,
                      where ``color`` needs to be replaced with any of the following
                      supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

                    Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render.
                    Display unsupported elements as literal characters by
                    backslash-escaping them. E.g. ``1\. Not an ordered list``.

                Returns
                -------
                list of containers
                    A list of container objects.

                Examples
                --------
                You can use `with` notation to insert any element into a tab:

                >>> import streamlit as st
                >>>
                >>> tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["Cat", "Dog", "Owl"])
                >>>
                >>> with tab1:
                ...    st.header("A cat")
                ...    st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/cat.jpg", width=200)
                ...
                >>> with tab2:
                ...    st.header("A dog")
                ...    st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/dog.jpg", width=200)
                ...
                >>> with tab3:
                ...    st.header("An owl")
                ...    st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/owl.jpg", width=200)

                .. output ::
                    https://doc-tabs1.streamlit.app/
                    height: 620px

                Or you can just call methods directly in the returned objects:

                >>> import streamlit as st
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>>
                >>> tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["ðŸ“ˆ Chart", "ðŸ—ƒ Data"])
                >>> data = np.random.randn(10, 1)
                >>>
                >>> tab1.subheader("A tab with a chart")
                >>> tab1.line_chart(data)
                >>>
                >>> tab2.subheader("A tab with the data")
                >>> tab2.write(data)


                .. output ::
                    https://doc-tabs2.streamlit.app/
                    height: 700px

                """
