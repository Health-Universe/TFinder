TEST = "TFinder makes it easy to extract gene regulatory regions by simply providing the gene name or its Gene ID " \
       "(<strong>Fig.1 Step 1.1, Fig.2, Fig.3</strong>). We have added an option to check if the gene is accessible for each species (\"Check genes availability\" button Fig.2). Since the ID gene already takes in account the species, it is not necessary to configure the species analyzed. This also implies that you are not limited to the five species proposed by the program. However, if you use the gene name, then the species will be required (<strong>Fig.1 Step 1.1 and 1.2</strong>). TFinder allows mixing of gene name and gene ID. Please select the desired species. You can therefore easily compare the same regulatory region of 2 or more different species with the gene ID for the same gene."

    st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-indent: 2em;">TFinder is a Python easy-to-use web tool for the identification of putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) in a sequence. It allows the extraction of the promoter or terminal regions of an unlimited number of genes via the NCBI API of up to five different species. The reference pattern (ex: a TFBS) accepts both IUPAC codes and JASPAR entries. It is also possible to generate and to use a Position Weight Matrix (PWM). Finally, the data may be recovered in either a tabular or graphic formats, showing the relevance score of the TFBSs found as a function of their relative position in the sequence. In this document, we will detail each part of TFinder, the methodology used and the resulting advantages and limitations of the software. TFinder is composed of two main modules that are structured in different sub-modules necessary for its functioning. We will not go into the specific details of the underlying code but will explain the principles and processes. We will first describe how to retrieve a nucleotide sequence on NCBI, then how to find a specific pattern in a nucleotide sequence.</p></div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

    st.markdown("<div style='text-align: justify;'><p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Transcription Factors are proteins that bind to DNA to regulate gene expression. They specifically recognize a nucleotide sequence called a Transcription Factor Binding Site present in the 5â€™ end (most of the time proximal and core promoter regions) and sometimes 3â€™ end of the regulatory sequences of a gene (terminator regions) (<strong>Fig.4</strong>). TFinder allows the extraction of these 2 regions. NCBI does not allow direct extraction of regions external to genes. You have to do an extraction directly on the chromosome. We therefore need to know on which chromosome is located the gene of interest, where it begins and ends. The API makes it possible to recover this information as well as GeneBank of the gene (see <strong>Fig.5</strong>). With the API we can find the start and end coordinates of the gene on the chromosome. By having these coordinates, it is possible to know the meaning. Chromosomal coordinates are in the 5` to 3` direction. This means that the first nucleotide is 1 and the last 100000 (for example). If a gene starts at chromosomal coordinates 200 and ends at 500, it is in the 5`-> 3` direction. If a gene starts at 500 but ends at 200, it's the other way around. This makes it possible to transform the extracted region always in the 5` to 3` direction of the gene. After obtaining the start and end coordinates, we can choose to extract the upstream/downstream information by setting the corresponding window (<strong>Fig.4</strong>). Thanks to the ACCESION of the chromosome by setting the coordinates calculated with the upstream/downstream button, one can extract the requested region.</p></div>", unsafe_allow_html=True) 
    st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-indent: 2em;">An "Advanced" mode allows you to choose more specifically what you want to extract (<strong>Fig.6</strong>). With this mode, you can select the region and species you want to recover for each gene. You can make a multiple selection. Of course, it is not possible to choose the species when using gene IDs, only for the gene names. However, in all cases, the region can be selected. The extracted sequences are converted to FASTA format (<strong>Fig.7</strong>).</p></div>', unsafe_allow_html=True) 
    st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-indent: 2em;"><strong>Note 1</strong>: the NCBI API does not allow to extract regions external to genes in a simple way. It is necessary to request the information concerning a piece of the chromosome. But the coordinates are dependent on the requested gene. NCBI does not provide coordinates for different transcripts of the same gene. TFinder displays the coordinates of the TSS or the gene end in the FASTA format in order to easier the transcript identification. You can hover your mouse over the NCBI genetic map to access the coordinates on the chromosome and the different transcripts below (<strong>Fig.8</strong>).</p></div>', unsafe_allow_html=True) 
    st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-indent: 2em;"><strong>Note 2</strong>: If you want to use your own FASTAs, you can. However, verify if they contain the TSS or the end of the gene at the same distance from the beginning of their sequence. Otherwise, you assume the inconsistency of the Relative Position. For the rest, TFinder recognizes if it is a promoter or a terminator if the name of the FASTA contains the "promoter" or "terminator" assignments.</p></div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

It allows the normalization with respect to the maximum PWM score of the reference TFBS while subtracting the minimum authorized score. The Relative Score represents the similarity between k-mer and the PWM. Thus, the closer the Relative Score is to 1, the more likely the TFBS identified is not a false positive. The p-value calculation is an information provided by TFinder that requires more processing time. In the p-value calculation, a 1000000 k-mer random sequence is generated taking in consideration the percentage of A, T, G and C in the analyzed target sequence and the length of the PWM. For each k-mer randomly generated, the Relative Score is calculated as described above. The p-value represents the probability that a random sequence has a relative score greater than or equal to the Relative Score of a TFBS.
